# Building and Testing

The best way to see what it does and to jump into examples is to build the package.

Run:

```
./test.sh
```

This will build the library and run a bunch of tests using SQLite. The test is also an
excellent example to get started and you can find it at:

```
./dbserialization/src/test/java/com/knossys/rnd/kshiro
```
